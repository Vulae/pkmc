# [pkmc](https://github.com/Vulae/pkmc)

Yet another Rust Minecraft server implementation.

Originally made so I can make a Minecraft server with custom features specifically for parkour.

I will **NOT** make anything use any async code.
This was originally built to be fully single-threaded, but that *may* change in the future.

## [Planned Features](#planned-features)

- [X] [Server list ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping)
- [ ] Configuration file
- [ ] World joining
- [ ] Packet compression
- [ ] Console commands
