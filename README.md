# [pkmc](https://github.com/Vulae/pkmc)

Yet another Rust Minecraft server implementation.

Originally made so I can make a Minecraft server with custom features specifically for parkour.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will only ever support the latest version (currently 1.21.4)

I will **NOT** make anything use any async code (tokio/futures).
This was originally built to be fully single-threaded, but that *may* change in the future.

## [Running](#running)

1. Clone repo
2. Start the server `cargo run --release`
3. Join the server (Default IP is `[::1]:52817`)

[pkmc.toml](./pkmc.toml) to configure.

| Entities              | ❌          |                           |
| Inventories           | ❌          |                           |

| Players & Chat        | ❌          |                           |

| WASM Plugins          | ❌          | Maybe not [^wasm-plugins] |

[^wasm-plugins]: Still don't know if I want this to be something you can make plugins for, or just a server you can just modify directly instead.

List of features that very likely will never be implemented:
- World Saving
- Command Blocks
- Redstone
- Vanilla World Ticking System
- Liquid Physics
- Entity Behavior / AI / Pathfinding
- Vanilla-like Worldgen
